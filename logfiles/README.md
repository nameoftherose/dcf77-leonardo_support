The remaining logs were produced by leonardo connected to the Conrad module.

>The signal is dominated by noise produced by computers in the room and their power supplies. The signal is useless.

When the leonardo is connected to the tablet running from batteries the signal is much cleaner.

During nighttime the signal is quite clear, but battery run out before synchronization was achieved. The log was lost. During the same night the Eurochron clock achieved synchronization.
