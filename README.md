# dcf77 library
This is **a copy of the dcf77-leonardo-support branch** of (dcf77 library)[https://github.com/nameoftherose/dcf77-leonardo_support/blob/master/README_original.md]. This branch was deleted by its author before I had the time to create a proper fork, so I had to create this repository from the zip file I had. Here is the original (README)[https://github.com/nameoftherose/dcf77-leonardo_support/blob/master/README_original.md]

As it now stands this repository documents an effort to use the library with the Conrad module in a residential area in central Crete. So far the only change in the sources is in (Swiss_Army_Debug_Helper)[https://github.com/nameoftherose/dcf77-leonardo_support/tree/master/examples/Swiss_Army_Debug_Helper]. The (logfiles)[https://github.com/nameoftherose/dcf77-leonardo_support/tree/master/logfiles] directory contains logs produced by Swiss_Army_Debug_Helper over a period of testing.
This effort was very frustrating and so far basically unssucceful. The is not due to a library deficiency but due to the great periods of time that the signal disappears, the noise coming through the USB power supply lines  and to the small antenna of the Conrand module. The logs are further discussed in (logfiles README)[https://github.com/nameoftherose/dcf77-leonardo_support/blob/master/logfiles/README.md].
